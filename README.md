# Sample Sails application that implements Winston logger via captians-log

This sample [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) application was created to test the changes made into 
[captains-log](https://github.com/balderdashy/captains-log) in this [PR](https://github.com/balderdashy/captains-log/pull/25), 
to make use of [Winston] logger.

This works also as an example of how you can configure Winston to look nice in your loggers 

Particularly check the [config/log.js](https://github.com/luislobo/sails-test-2019/blob/master/config/log.js) file
to see how the [Winston] integration was made.
